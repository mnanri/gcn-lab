# GNN experimental inspection
process of install library for Mac
```
$ brew install python # install python for using pip3 (or pip).
$ pip3 --version # check whether pip is installed, or not. if you cannot use pip3, try to use pip.
$ pip3 install torch==1.12.0 # install PyTorch, pay attention of dependency for Pytorch-Geometric version.

# To install Pytorch-Geometric, visit following site.
# https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html

# e.g. If you install Pytorch-Geometric under the following env;
# PyTorch: PyTorch 1.12*,
# Your OS: Mac,
# Package: Pip,
# CUDA: CPU,
# you can run following command.
$ pip install torch-scatter torch-sparse torch-cluster torch-spline-conv torch-geometric -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-1.12.0+cpu.html

$ pip3 install networkx # install networkx to handle visualized figures.
$ pip3 install matplotlib # install matplotlib to draw figures

## GCN karate club classification task
The graph contains 34 nodes, connected by 156 (undirected and unweighted) edges. Every node is labeled by one of 4 classes obtained via modularity-based clustering.
```
$ python3 ./karate_club/karate_club_gcn.py

train data: {
  nodes: 34
  edges: 156
  features: 34
  classes: 4
}
test dataset: 340 # changed about 10% of edges in train data.
convolution layer: 2
epoch count: 100
average of accuracy: 93.40%
```

## GCN Amazon Computers classification task
Nodes represent products and edges represent co-purchasing relations. The task is to map products to their respective product category based on the productâ€™s co-purchasing network.
```
$ python3 ./amazon_computers/amazon_computers.py

train dataset: {
  nodes: 13752
  egdes: 491722
  features: 767
  classes: 10
}
test dataset: 137 # changed about 1% of edges in train data.
convolution layer: 6
epoch count: 1000

accuracy: 87.51%
average of accuracy in test dataset: 41.57%
```
